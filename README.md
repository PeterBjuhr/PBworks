Collection of my musical compositions and other art music related creations.

##Content
What can be expected to be found here? It's of course an interesting philosophical question what a work essentially consists of. To simplify matters both legally (see below) and philosophically the basic principal is that what is included here is only instructions for how the work may be performed and not an actual performance (or a documentation of a performance). 

In addition to this, material important for the creation of the work is also included here. As the work normally is represented by a musical score, and I currently use LilyPond to produce these scores this library may involve a lot of LilyPond source code. See my short introduction to LilyPond code.

##License
The license may vary for each work, but I basically like to use some Creative Commons license with an added performance restriction. In an informal description, sharing of the works is encouraged but when the work is performed I obtain my default rights.
